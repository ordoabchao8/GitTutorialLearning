Hello World repository for Git tutorial
This is an example repository for the Git tutoial on https://www.w3schools.com
This tutorial focuses mainly on Git and using GitHub as its remote.

This tutorial is fun and I feel like it is far better than the one offered by Microsoft.
The microsoft tutorial is not very intuitive as it does not allow you to work in your own local environment, 
yet with clear and concise instructions, this tutorial allows for a far better learning experience in the code editor of your choice.

It now includes steps for GitHub, git merge, and git branches.

This repository is built step by step in the tutorial.
